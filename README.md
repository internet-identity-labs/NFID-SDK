## Introduction[](#introduction)

**NFID-SDK** is an open source software development kit that contains libraries and examples for developers to integrate NFID into your applications. It can be used across a wide range of use cases, and it is designed to be easy to integrate into your existing application by providing the right set of libraries and components. 

> ðŸ’¡ The NFID-SDK is currently limited to integration with React applications only, and the team is actively developing to expand and include other libraries and components for integration, such as Vue and Svelte.

### Composition[](#composition)
Currently our *React* components are used to integrate NFID, and the UI utility library is used to provide a consistent look and feel across all of our sample applications.

NFID-SDK consists of the following `packages`:
