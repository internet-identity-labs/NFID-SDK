## Introduction[](#introduction)

**NFID-SDK** is an open source software development kit that contains examples and packages for developers to integrate NFID into your application. The SDK is designed to provide an overview of all installable packages that will help you easily integrate the appropriate packages into your existing application and include the appropriate examples.

> ðŸ’¡ The NFID-SDK is currently limited to integration with React applications only, and the team is actively developing to expand and include other libraries and components for integration, such as Vue and Svelte.

If you want to integrate NFID into your React application, we offer certain **packages**. [`nfid-sdk-react`](#packages) is the main package that you need to add to your project as a dependency. You can find more details about exactly what it does in the package itself. For all the packages NFID offers, check out the `packages` section.

We have also prepared some **examples** to show how we use these packages. This will ensure that you get a clear picture of what exactly is needed to fully integrate NFID. 

A fully developed application with NFID integrated using React is available in the [`create-ic-app-react-demo`](#examples) example

### DFX

We run on **DFX v0.9.3** so you will need to install this specific version. If you have an older version, run this command to install this specific version: 
```bash
DFX_VERSION=0.9.3 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
```

A step-by-step guide on how to set up your DFX can be found [here](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/developers-guide/install-upgrade-remove.html).
