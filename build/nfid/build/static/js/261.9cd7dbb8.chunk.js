Some wallets offer that (NFID being one of them), though most don't. What's not been discussed often enough is how vulnerable the interface is between you and you private key. If that interface is hosted on centralized Web2 architecture like AWS or Apple/Google, it's an attack vector since governments, the company itself, or individual attackers all have ways of gaining access or even deactivating the interface.

If you're registering with a DAO, the process should protect against voting manipulation or resource extraction. Some wallets take an approach of requiring pre-authorization (i.e. KYC), others require registering a photo or video of yourself for community approval, and some rely on other services to issue your wallet a credential attesting you are a unique human (further risking exposure of your identity since it's issued to the same wallet identifier). NFID takes the approach that there will be many services attesting many different things about you.
